# Multilingual Translation Demo for train stations #

_(A demo video is provided at bottom of the page)_

This is a flask-based web application where you can preview translations of announcements in different languages, and create custom profiles for specific announcements in languages of your choice!
The translations use gTTS and the Translator libraries, and the front-end is made using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.
This was actually made as a minor college project, and was made in less time (2-3 days), so the code could be quite redundant or buggy, so please feel free to make required changes in your local copy.
